        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            2D rendering on the early web was mainly based on HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
            This made it possible to present the content in a simple layout. 2D web rendering was greatly enhanced by introducing the canvas element and the Canvas API in HTML5.
            JavaScript allowed programmers to create dynamic graphics, allowing for more engaging and aesthetically pleasing online applications.
            SVG is a vector image format that supports 2D graphics and is based on XML. It makes it possible to produce interactive and scalable graphics for the Internet.
            For vector graphics on the web, SVG has become the standard.<br />

            The industry standard that emerged for rendering 3D graphics in web browsers is called WebGL (Web Graphics Library).
            It is an OpenGL ES-based JavaScript API that lets programmers make 3D visuals that can be rendered in the browser without plugins.
            Specifically, the Khronos Group supports WebGL. <br />
            <br />

            Standard Organizations:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): W3C has created and upheld web technology standards.
                    Among the standards that W3C develops and maintains are HTML, CSS, and SVG.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Khronos Group is an alliance of businesses that work together to develop open-standard APIs for parallel computing and graphics.
                    One such standard created by the Khronos Group is WebGL.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Adopted standards:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    WebGPU: Developed by the W3C and GPU for the Web Community Group, WebGPU is an emerging standard.
                    With its low-level, contemporary API, it hopes to make it easier for developers to take advantage of the power of contemporary GPUs when creating 2D and 3D graphics for the web.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WebAssembly (Wasm): Although not strictly speaking a graphics standard, WebAssembly has affected web rendering by enabling languages other than JavaScript for tasks requiring high performance.
                    This makes it possible to use languages for graphics-intensive applications like C++ and Rust.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            In conclusion, standards and technologies have evolved over the history of 2D and 3D rendering on the web, with important roles played by HTML, CSS, SVG, WebGL, WebGPU, and WebAssembly. 
            Among the standards organizations advancing these technologies' development are W3C and Khronos Group.
