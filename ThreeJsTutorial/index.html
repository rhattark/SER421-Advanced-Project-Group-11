        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            2D rendering on the early web was mainly based on HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
            This made it possible to present the content in a simple layout. 2D web rendering was greatly enhanced by introducing the canvas element and the Canvas API in HTML5.
            JavaScript allowed programmers to create dynamic graphics, allowing for more engaging and aesthetically pleasing online applications.
            SVG is a vector image format that supports 2D graphics and is based on XML. It makes it possible to produce interactive and scalable graphics for the Internet.
            For vector graphics on the web, SVG has become the standard.<br />

            The industry standard that emerged for rendering 3D graphics in web browsers is called WebGL (Web Graphics Library).
            It is an OpenGL ES-based JavaScript API that lets programmers make 3D visuals that can be rendered in the browser without plugins.
            Specifically, the Khronos Group supports WebGL. <br />
            <br />

            Standard Organizations:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): W3C has created and upheld web technology standards.
                    Among the standards that W3C develops and maintains are HTML, CSS, and SVG.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Khronos Group is an alliance of businesses that work together to develop open-standard APIs for parallel computing and graphics.
                    One such standard created by the Khronos Group is WebGL.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Adopted standards:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    WebGPU: Developed by the W3C and GPU for the Web Community Group, WebGPU is an emerging standard.
                    With its low-level, contemporary API, it hopes to make it easier for developers to take advantage of the power of contemporary GPUs when creating 2D and 3D graphics for the web.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WebAssembly (Wasm): Although not strictly speaking a graphics standard, WebAssembly has affected web rendering by enabling languages other than JavaScript for tasks requiring high performance.
                    This makes it possible to use languages for graphics-intensive applications like C++ and Rust.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            In conclusion, standards and technologies have evolved over the history of 2D and 3D rendering on the web, with important roles played by HTML, CSS, SVG, WebGL, WebGPU, and WebAssembly.
            Among the standards organizations advancing these technologies' development are W3C and Khronos Group.

        <h2>Analytical Component</h2>
        <p>
            Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API that provides higher-level abstraction for creating 2D and 3D graphics and increases accessibility for rendering. Three.js has an editor which allows users to create and edit scenes visually.

            Three.js uses WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering dynamic 2D and 3D graphics in web browsers without plugins. With the use of WebGL, three.js enables your browser to render 3D animation, and being cross-browser smoothly provides huge leverage of multi-dimensional objects across the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ease of Use and Documentation:</b>Three.js has good performance and great documentation with plenty of examples and a large community with many third-party plugins for developers. 
                Additionally, many online tutorials and courses cover all aspects of rendering 3D objects and merging different 3D models into a single scene.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Performance and Optimization:</b>It leverages the power of the GPU to render smooth and realistic 3D animation, using advanced techniques such as PBR rendering, shadows, and post-processing effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Creativity and Diversity:</b>Another benefit of Three.js is that it works with most contemporary browsers without requiring any plugins or extensions. 
                    It also works on various devices and adapts to the responsivity of different screen sizes and resolutions. 
                    Three.js also supports VR and AR applications, using WebXR and other technologies.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Cons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>The complexity of programming in 3D:</b>Three.js can be complex at times since you need to be able to think in terms of 3D placements and the x, y, and z coordinates and not the usual 2D plane that we are used to. 
                    We faced this issue while trying to place items and rotate them as we wanted. It has a decent amount of learning curve. However, we could develop faster once we got the hang of it.
                </li>
                <li><b>Lack of features for interactive application:</b>Three.js doesn’t provide features beyond model creation and setup. 
                If a developer wants to create a game engine, they may need additional libraries or frameworks to implement their solution.</li>
                <li><b>API geared towards novices:</b>Although Three.js has a simple and easy-to-use API, it may not be suitable for advanced and professional developers as their requirements are more controlled and flexible over the rendering pipeline and low-level details. 
                Moreover, some advanced features are hidden or abstracted from the developers, which might limit their possibilities.  </li>
            </ul>
